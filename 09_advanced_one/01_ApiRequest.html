//fetch is new, before we used to do XML http requests.Its like legacy way of make requests. but it's used less in todays time by devs.

//V8 engine runs JS like other JS engine. Nodejs is also an implementation of V8 engine. JS actually runs thru C++, similarly Python runs on C++. these wrapper languages made on C++.

//console.log(); is part of JS? it is & it is not.It is a debugger tool of our devtools.So , its not there in JS, JS runtime injects it. like this other APis like document , document.getElement, are not part of core JS
